What the program does:
This program takes in three inputs from the user: their name, a color, and the name of a pet (ex: Pumpkin, Shadow, Cinnamon - NOT the type of animal the pet is)
The program will then count and return how long each word is, how many vowels each word has, and how many consonants each word has. 

How to install:
Installing this program is very simple. It is not a complicated program, so all you need to do is download the main.py file and run it on any IDE. You could also run it on any command line

How to use:
This is a very trivial program, so it is only used for your amusement and if you do not feel like counting the length, vowels or consonants of cetain words :)

How to contribute:
If you would like to help and contribute to the project, or if you would like to correct any bugs you find, you may submit a pull request for the main.py file, which contains all of the functionality of the code. This will allow to request any changes by altering the code and asking for approval. Please keep the code of conduct in mind when submitting changes. Any help and contributions would be greatly appreciated, since we are here to make people have fun!
